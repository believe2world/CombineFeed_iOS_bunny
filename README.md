# CombineFeedback

Unidirectional Reactive Architecture. This is a [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) implemetation of [ReactiveFeedbback](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/ReactiveFeedback) and [RxFeedback](https://github.com/kzaher/RxFeedback)

## Motivation

Requirements for iOS apps have become huge. Our code has to manage a lot of state e.g. server responses, cached data, UI state, routing etc. Some may say that Reactive Programming can help us a lot but, in the wrong hands, it can do even more harm to your code base.

The goal of this library is to provide a simple and intuitive approach to designing reactive state machines.

## Core Concepts

### State 

`State` is the single source of truth. It represents a state of your system and is usually a plain Swift type. Your state is immutable. The only way to transition from one `State` to another is to emit an `Event`.

### Event

Represents all possible events that can happen in your system which can cause a transition to a new `State`.

### Reducer 

A Reducer is a pure function with a signature of `(State, Event) -> State`. While `Event` represents an action that results in a `State` change, it's actually not what _causes_ the change. An `Event` is just that, a representation of the intention to transition from one state to another. What actually causes the `State` to change, the embodiment of the corresponding `Event`, is a Reducer. A Reducer is the only place where a `State` can be changed.

### Feedback

While `State` represents where the system is at a given time, `Event` represents a state change, and a `Reducer` is the pure function that enacts the event causing the state to change, there is not as of yet any type to decide which event should take place given a particular current state. That's the job of the `Feedback`. It's essentially a "processing engine", listening to changes in the current `State` and emitting the corresponding next events to take place. Feedbacks don't directly mutate states. Instead, they only emit events which then cause states to change in reducers.

To some extent it's like reactive [Middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware) in [Redux](https://redux.js.org) having a signature of `(AnyPublisher<State, Never>) -> AnyPublisher<Event, Never>` allows us to observe `State` changes and perform some side effects based on its changes e.g if a system is in `loading` state we can start fetching data from network.



### UI as a Feedback ðŸ¤¯

This repo contains an [example](CombineFeedbackUI/SwiftUIFeedback.swift) of UIFeedback loop inspired by the work of [@Krunoslav Zaher](https://twitter.com/KrunoslavZaher) in [RxFeedback-React](https://github.com/NoTests/RxFeedback-React) specifically [here](https://github.com/NoTests/RxFeedback-React/blob/master/src/index.ts#L37).

Why `UI` can be treated as a `Feedback` loop:

- To some extent, UI is a part of the system. When the state changes we want to react to it and render new information to the user.
- User may interact with our system by pressing buttons and views emitting `Event` into it
